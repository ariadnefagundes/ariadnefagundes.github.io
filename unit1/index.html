  <h1><center>Taylor Swift’s Fight to Regain Ownership of Her Music</h1></center>

  <!-- paragraph with a strong and em element -->
  <p>Taylor Swift’s battle to regain  <strong>ownership</strong> of her music began in June 2019, when her former label, Big Machine Records, was sold to Scooter Braun, giving him control over the master recordings of her first six albums. Swift publicly objected, saying she was not given a fair chance to buy them herself.

  <h2>Re-Recordings:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>"Fearless (Taylor’s Version)" – April 2021</li>
    <li>"Red (Taylor’s Version)" – November 2021</li>
    <li>"Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)" – July 2023</li>
    <li>"1989 (Taylor’s Version)" – October 2023</li> 
    </ul>
  In May 30, 2025 Taylor Swift officially <em>bought back the master recordings and full rights</em> to her first six albums from Shamrock Capital for approximately <b>$360 million</b>.  
  By reclaiming her masters in May 2025, Swift achieved full ownership of her catalog—a landmark win for artists’   rights and a powerful demonstration of creative autonomy.
